"""
Dynamic Model Weight Adjuster
==============================
Real-world-style regime-conditional, performance-adaptive model weighting.

In production quant systems (Renaissance, Two Sigma, Citadel), model weights
are NEVER static. They are adjusted based on:

1. Market Regime:    Each model has strengths in specific regimes
2. Recent Performance: Models that predicted well recently get higher weight
3. Signal Agreement: Consensus signals get boosted, conflicting signals get damped
4. Decay:            Older performance fades via exponential decay

This replaces the naive equal-weight (15% each) approach with a system
that mirrors how real hedge funds allocate signal capital.
